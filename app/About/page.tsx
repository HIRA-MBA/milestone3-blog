This project is a dynamic blog application built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS. It allows users to view blog posts and interact with the content by leaving comments. The blog posts are fetched based on a dynamic route, and the comment form captures user input (name, email, and comment). Upon submission, the form data is logged to the console, and a thank-you message is displayed. Tailwind CSS ensures that the application is visually appealing, responsive, and easy to maintain, while Next.js powers the server-side rendering and dynamic routing functionalities. This project also highlights the integration of user interaction and form validation within a modern web framework.
